// Arrays
let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let listGeneric: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];

// Tuples
// Having an array of the same value types is useful, but sometimes you have an array that contains values of mixed types. For that purpose, TypeScript provides the Tuple type.
let person1: [string, number] = ['Marcia', 35];
